# Deploying Fini on Zendesk

Integrating Fini with your Zendesk is straightforward and can be done in a few simple steps. Below is a detailed guide on how to deploy and configure Fini for your Zendesk account.

## 1. Connect Fini to Your Zendesk

1. **Access Deployment**:  
   Navigate to the **Deploy** section within the Fini dashboard.

2. **Select Integration**:  
   Choose the **Zendesk integration** and click **Connect**.
3. **Add Your Subdomain**:  
   Enter the **subdomain** for your Zendesk account. This is a unique identifier.
4. **Add Your Account ID**:  
   Input your **Account ID** to establish the connection.
5. **Proceed to Next Step**:  
   After filling out these details, move on to the **Email Configuration** section.

## 2. Configure Email Settings

You'll be taken to the email configuration screen, which allows you to set up Fini's responses to Zendesk email tickets. Here's how to customize the settings:

### **Select the Bot**

Choose the specific **bot** you wish to deploy for managing Zendesk tickets.

### **Reply Settings**

The following settings determine how Fini will interact with your customers:

#### **Time Delay**  
If you want Fini to wait before responding to messages (creating a more natural, human-like interaction), set a **time delay**. The delay is in **seconds**; for example, enter `3600` to delay by an hour.

#### **Debounce Lag**  
Set a **debounce lag** to introduce a delay before the bot replies. This is particularly useful if a user sends multiple messages about the same issue. During the delay, Fini assesses all incoming messages to generate a more accurate and relevant response.

#### **Reply Type**  
Choose how Fini should respond:
- **Direct Replies**: Fini responds directly to the customer.
- **Internal Comments**: Fini adds internal comments visible only to agents, not the end-user.

#### **Reply Type If Agent Assigned**  
Configure how Fini behaves when a support agent is assigned to a ticket:
- **Reply to End User**: Fini continues engaging with the customer even after agent assignment.
- **Post Internal Comment**: Fini stops communicating directly with the customer and instead posts updates as internal comments for the support team.
- **Go Silent**: Fini stops all activity on the ticket, allowing the agent to handle it entirely.

### **PII Masking**  
To protect **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**, enable PII masking. When enabled, Fini will avoid using personal data (like the user's name) in responses, providing a generalized interaction.

**Example**:  
With PII masking:  
*"Hello, how can I assist you today?"*

Without PII masking:  
*"Hello, John, how can I assist you today?"*

## 3. Assign Tickets to Fini

Automate ticket management by assigning tickets to Fini. This enables further automation (e.g., auto-solving tickets) and analytics within Zendesk.

> **Note**: If you already have specific assignment rules in place, you may keep this option set to **No**.

## 4. Configure Escalation Settings

Manage Finiâ€™s behavior for ticket escalations to human agents.

### **Action if Escalated**  
Define what happens if Fini encounters a question it cannot answer (e.g., sensitive topics):
- **Continue Responding**: Fini will continue to engage even after escalation.
- **Go Silent**: Fini stops replying after escalation.
- **Send Acknowledgement Message**: Fini sends a customizable acknowledgment message to the customer once escalation occurs.

**Suggested Message**:  
> "Thank you for the additional information. This will be included in the ticket for our specialized human agent team."

### **Threshold Count for Escalation**  
Set a **threshold** for the maximum number of replies before escalation. If Fini cannot resolve an issue within a set number of replies (e.g., 5 or 10), the ticket is escalated to a human agent.

**Suggested Message When Threshold is Reached**:  
> "Thank you for your message. Unfortunately, this is outside of my expertise, and I will need to escalate this to our specialized support team. A member of our team will reach out shortly."

## 5. Authorize Fini

Complete the **authorization process** by clicking **Authorize**. This will establish a secure connection between Fini and your Zendesk account.

## 6. Configure Ticket Categorization

Once authorization is complete, a new **Categorization** section will appear.

### **Enable Categorization**  
Toggle the **Categorization** setting to allow Fini to automatically categorize tickets based on their content using AI.

### **Categorization Settings**  
1. **Select a Categorization Field**:  
   Choose a multi-select field from Zendesk that contains all necessary categories. Fini will use this field to categorize tickets.
2. **Category Add Type**:  
   - **Append Categories**: Add new categories with each reply.
   - **Overwrite Categories**: Maintain only one active category per reply.
3. **Category Limit**:  
   Define how many categories should be assigned per reply.

After completing these steps, your Zendesk setup is complete, and Fini is ready to manage and enhance your customer support experience.
