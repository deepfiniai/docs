</ParamField>

<ParamField body="function_call" type="string or object">
Controls how the model responds to function calls. "none" means the model does not call a function, and responds to the end-user. "auto" means the model can pick between an end-user or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"name":\ "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function. "none" is the default when no functions are present. "auto" is the default if functions are present.

  Whether to stream back partial progress.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="temperature" type="number" default="0.4">
  What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We recommend using 0.4 as the default.
