<Card title="Use all information" icon="envelope" iconType="duotone" color="#ea5a0c">
  Fini has the unique ability to read all types of content formats (Web links, Pdfs, Docs, JSON, YAML, CSV files and a lot more). Make sure to use this capability and ingest all information that can be useful for the bot to answer questions 
</Card>

<Card title="One page articles" icon="file" iconType="duotone" color="#6433FF">
  Always have short one-page articles which details out the solution to a specific problem. This will make sure that the AI can understand the information effectively. Here is a good example: [Instacart Help Center](https://www.instacart.com/help/section/360007902851/360039162832)
</Card>

<Card title="Add Explanatory Text to Images, Videos and Flowcharts" icon="pen-to-square" iconType="duotone" color="#0285c7">
  LLMs are not great at interpreting images or videos. Including step-by-step instructions for your visual content to ensure Fini can effectively use this information to assist customers.
</Card>

<Card title="Update your knowledgebase" icon="lightbulb" iconType="duotone" color="#16a34a">
  Fini regularly keeps referring to your knowledgebase to make sure that the AI has all the latest content. Make sure to keep your knowledgebase updated
</Card>

<Card title="Clear explanations" icon="circle-check" iconType="duotone" color="#ca8b04">
  Make sure your existing content is clear, straightforward, and comprehensive. If it's confusing for a human to read, it'll be confusing for Fini and the AI to read as well. Clear and simple language, scannable structures, and full sentence answers instead of just "yes" or "no" are crucial for optimization.
